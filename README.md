# Icewind Dale 2

In this repository you'll find reverse engineered source code for Icewind Dale II.

## Status

- Functions: 54% (~5500 of ~10000)

- Code: 24% (~0.9M of ~3.8M)

The game is not playable at this time. Even though it does run, you can only access several UI screens - start (which is actually a multiplayer connection screen in other Infinity Engine games), options, keymaps, party selection, and character editor. Many stuff needs to be done in order to get to world screen (the one where actual gameplay occurs).

If you like to see it for yourself be sure to obtain Icewind Dale II: Complete  from [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/icewind_dale_2). I've hardcoded it's installation path for testing and it accidenally slipped into Git some time ago. Only windowed 32-bpp mode is currently implemented.
